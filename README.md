# DEPRECATED NOTICE

The development of this project has been discontinued. Development will continue on [feishin](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin)

### What is the best way to stay updated on the project?

Please star the repo and follow the project for updates. You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/FVKpcMDy5f) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#sonixd:matrix.org) servers where I post periodic updates and answer questions.

### How do I contribute to the project?

Pull requests are welcome!

To run the application in development, you to install the following dependencies:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Tauri CLI](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/cli/)

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the application in development mode with the following command:

```bash
# 1. In the root directory, run the following command
$ bun run init

# OR

# 1. Initialize the project manually
$ bun install
$ bun run build:packages
$ bun run build:server:desktop # And then copy the server binary to the /apps/web/src-tauri/target/external directory

# Open two terminals and navigate to the /apps/web and /apps/server directory respectively. The order you run the commands in matters, since running the web app will attempt to start the server separately.

# 2a. In terminal 1, run the following command in the /apps/server directory
$ bun run dev

# 2b. In terminal 2, run the following command in the /apps/web directory
$ bun run dev

```

### Building the application

To build the application locally, you will need to remove all references to the updater plugin from the tauri configuration files.

1. [tauri.conf.json](./apps/web/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json)
2. [desktop.json](./apps/web/src-tauri/capabilities/desktop.json)
3. [main.rs](./apps/web/src-tauri/src/main.rs)
4. [Cargo.toml](./apps/web/src-tauri/Cargo.toml)
5. [publish.yml](./apps/web/src-tauri/publish.yml)

After removing the updater plugin, you can build the application using the following command:

```bash
$ bun run deploy
```

The built application will be located in the [./apps/web/src-tauri/target/release](./apps/web/src-tauri/target/release) directory.
